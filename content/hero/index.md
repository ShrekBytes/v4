I don't know, it's a little complicated - Things we said, can I take them all back? - Memories, all fuzzy and faded - Funny how our dreams come to an end - So I built a wall around my little heart - Sometimes things break and they fall apart - But there's one thing that I know - Someday (Someday) - We will be together again (Together again) - Someday I'll hold your hand again (Hold your hand) - And look into your eyes and say - That we were (We were never meant) - Never meant to be apart (I miss you) - If only that moment was now - If only that day was today.
